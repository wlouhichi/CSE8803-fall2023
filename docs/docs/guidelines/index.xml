      <description>Office Hours # Overview # TAs plan to hold office hours starting week 2, except on Georgia Tech holidays (e.g., thanksgiving, MLK day, spring break). Each office hour session will be run by at least one TA, and is 1 hour long. See GTâ€™s academic calendar for the full list of holidays https://registrar.gatech.edu/calendar. We will spread the office hours across weekdays, and across time of the day. We will announce the office hour times.</description>

      <description>Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion # Just as machine learning algorithms cannot accomplish complex tasks if trained on datasets of limited variability, our course cannot be successful without appreciating the diversity of our students. In this class we aim to create an environment where all voices are valued, respecting the diversity of gender, sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, ability, ethnicity, race, and culture. We always welcome suggestions that can help us achieve this goal.</description>
