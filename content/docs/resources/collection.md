## How to manage multiple versions of Python packages? 
- To get started, we recommend the excellent article on [Which Python package manager should you use?](https://towardsdatascience.com/which-python-package-manager-should-you-use-d0fd0789a250)

- If you've decided to go with pyenv, I recommend [Managing Multiple Python Versions With pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/). 

- If you use Mac, we recommend to also check out [The right and wrong way to set Python 3 as default on a Mac](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac). 

- Explore using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) which seems to be fast replacing conda envs, and may even replace setuptools for pypi packages in the future.
