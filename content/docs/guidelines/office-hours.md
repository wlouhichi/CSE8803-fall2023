# Office Hours

## Overview

- TAs plan to hold office hours starting week 2, except on Georgia Tech holidays (e.g., thanksgiving, MLK day, spring break). Each office hour session will be run by at least one TA, and is 1 hour long. See GTâ€™s academic calendar for the full list of holidays [https://registrar.gatech.edu/calendar](https://registrar.gatech.edu/calendar). We will spread the office hours across weekdays, and across time of the day. We will announce the office hour times.

- We will hold office hours via Ed Chat Channel, where the TA running the office hour will be responsive. We will share information about how to join the appropriate Ed Chat Channel.

- Please note that you are always welcome to ask questions on Ed. Office hours supplement Ed, and do not replace it.
