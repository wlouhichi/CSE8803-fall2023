# Diversity & Inclusion

Just as machine learning algorithms cannot accomplish complex tasks if trained on datasets of limited variability, our course cannot be successful without appreciating the diversity of our students. In this class we aim to create an environment where all voices are valued, respecting the diversity of gender, sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, ability, ethnicity, race, and culture. We always welcome suggestions that can help us achieve this goal. Additionally, if any of our class scheduled activities conflicts with religious events, please inform the instruction team so that we can make appropriate arrangements for you.

**Students with disabilities**: your access to this course is extremely important to us. The institute has policies regarding disability accommodation, which are administered through the Office of Disability Services: http://disabilityservices.gatech.edu. Please request your accommodation letter as early in the semester as possible, so that we have adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations.
